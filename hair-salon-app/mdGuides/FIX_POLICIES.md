# 🔧 Fix Supabase Policies

## The Issue

You got this error because some policies already exist in your database:
```
ERROR: policy "Allow public read access to active services" for table "services" already exists
```

## ✅ Quick Fix

### Option 1: Run the New Script (Recommended)

I've created a new SQL script that handles existing policies properly.

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy and paste the contents of **`add-admin-policies.sql`**
4. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

This script will:
- Drop any existing policies (to avoid conflicts)
- Create fresh policies with the correct permissions
- Show you all policies at the end for verification

### Option 2: Manual Steps

If you prefer to do it manually:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Policies**
2. Find the `services` table
3. **Delete all existing policies** for the services table
4. Then run the `add-admin-policies.sql` script

## 🎯 What These Policies Do

The new policies allow:
- ✅ **SELECT** - Read all services (for admin table view)
- ✅ **INSERT** - Create new services
- ✅ **UPDATE** - Edit existing services
- ✅ **DELETE** - Remove services

## ⚠️ Security Note

**These policies allow public access for development!**

For production, you should:
1. Add authentication (Supabase Auth)
2. Create an admin role
3. Update policies to check for admin role

Example production policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow admin insert services"
  ON services
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin'
  );
```

## ✅ Verify It Worked

After running the script, you should see output showing 4 policies:
1. Allow public read all services
2. Allow public insert services
3. Allow public update services
4. Allow public delete services

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once the policies are updated:

1. **Start your app:**
   ```bash
   cd hair-salon-app
   npm start
   ```

2. **Go to admin panel:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200/admin
   ```

3. **Test CRUD operations:**
   - Create a new service
   - Edit an existing service
   - Toggle active/inactive
   - Delete a service

Everything should work now! 🎉

## 🐛 Still Having Issues?

If you still get errors:

1. **Check Supabase logs:**
   - Dashboard → Logs → Look for errors

2. **Verify your API key:**
   - Make sure you're using the **anon/public** key
   - Check `src/environments/environment.ts`

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12
   - Look for error messages

4. **Test the connection:**
   - Go to home page first
   - See if services load
   - Then try admin panel
